            Perform weekly repository maintenance:

            1. Review that the documentation is up to date with the code
            3. Review open issues older than 90 days
            4. Check for TODO comments in recent commits
            5. Verify README.md examples still work

            Create a single issue summarizing any findings.
            If critical security issues are found, also comment on open PRs.
